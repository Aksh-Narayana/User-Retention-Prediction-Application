# IDEA PROPOSALS:


## Title: User retention prediction for application developers

Problem Statement: 

For application developers, a potential challenge for them would be the user retention. They need a realiable and reuseable method to simluate the retention rates of their users so that they can figure out which group of users are likely to be retained/churned. In this way, they can later on keep different users interested in their product by performing corresponidng retention task.

Abstract:

Create a cloud hosted BigQuery machine learning model to determine the likelihood rates of users continue to use the app based on the user behaverior logs and user demographic information.

Approach:
1. Pre-process the training data using user's demographic and behavioural logs.
2. Train and evaluate machine learing models using BigQuery ML in GCP.
3. Make predictions using the terminative ML model.
4. Create project dashboard and perform visualization of the prediction results.

Technology Stack:

Python, Bigquery(SQL), GCP

Persona:

Undecided

## Title:  Medical insurance cost prediction for citizen 

Problem Statement:

The objective of this article is to accurately predict insurance costs based on people’s data, including age, Body Mass Index, smoking or not, etc. Additionally, we will also determine what the most important variable influencing insurance costs is. These estimates could be used to create actuarial tables that set the price of yearly premiums higher or lower according to the expected treatment costs. This is a regression problem.
