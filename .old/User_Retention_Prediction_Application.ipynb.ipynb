They need a realiable and reuseable method to simluate the retention rates of their users so that they can figure out which group of users are likely to be retained/churned. In this way, they can later on keep different users interested in their product by performing corresponidng retention task.\n","\n","* Abstract:\n","\n","  * Create a cloud hosted BigQuery machine learning model to determine the likelihood rates of users continue to use the app based on the user behaverior logs and user demographic information.\n","\n","* Approach:\n","\n","  * Pre-process the training data using user's demographic and behavioural logs. \n","  * Train and evaluate machine learing models using BigQuery ML in GCP.\n","  * Make predictions using the terminative ML model.\n","  * Create project dashboard and perform visualization of the prediction results.\n","\n","* Technology Stack:\n","\n","  * Python, Bigquery(SQL), GCP\n","\n","* Dataset:\n","  * In this application, we will be using a public dataset provided by GCP: an event based dataset which is generated by a real-world gaming mobile app called 'Flood-it!' that contains 5700000 event log infos from more than 15175 users.\n","  * Dataset format: Google Analytics 4 property data and the Google Analytics for Firebase data that is exported to BigQuery Export schema\n","  * Dataset URL: https://developers.google.com/analytics/bigquery/app-gaming-demo-dataset\n","  * Flood-it! App URL: https://flood-it.app/ \n","\n","* Persona:\n","  * Mobile Game developers who need to know the user retention rate and coresspoinding analytic data regarding their aplication. Knowing all these data would be significantly useful for them to form better targetd and customized user retention task on user in different retention categories.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1x5N3YwLzWL_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Environment Setup\n","Install packages and dependencies, and create a GCP project"],"metadata":{"id":"J1J1IGU24pPD"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lm8-tIUHzSpC"},"outputs":[],"source":["# run it if you haven't install GCS \n","!pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# run it if you haven't install GCB\n","!pip install  google-cloud-bigquery"],"metadata":{"id":"vyVYV1EO40so"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Automatically restart kernel after installs\n","import IPython\n","app = IPython.Application.instance()\n","app.kernel.do_shutdown(True) "],"metadata":{"id":"zOgFpIrI49D2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Log in google cloud\n","!gcloud auth login"],"metadata":{"id":"XECd0Mhp4-JT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# mount google drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive/')"],"metadata":{"id":"3FUU3dgY5JCM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# configure the google application credentials: a json file generates by your GCP account\n","import os\n","os.environ[\"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\"]=\"/content/gdrive/My Drive/CMPE 272/cmpe-272-test.json\""],"metadata":{"id":"CYUBYYaH5J7v"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# configure project name and region\n","PROJECT_ID = \"cmpe-272-test\"\n","REGION = 'US'"],"metadata":{"id":"Cn6LcKtN5U7H"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# set the configuration\n","!gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID"],"metadata":{"id":"NpyTWu5b5XA-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# import dependencies\n","from google.cloud import bigquery\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","pd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.3f' % x)"],"metadata":{"id":"i-2MOqC45cFK"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Check Google Cloud API authentication and credentials\n","def implicit():\n","    from google.cloud import storage\n","\n","    # If you don't specify credentials when constructing the client, the\n","    # client library will look for credentials in the environment.\n","    storage_client = storage.Client()\n","\n","    # Make an authenticated API request\n","    buckets = list(storage_client.list_buckets())\n","    print(buckets)\n","\n","implicit()"],"metadata":{"id":"OXzF7wOT5tPe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Data Preparation"],"metadata":{"id":"uvQQov1X7_Yg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Data Acquisition"],"metadata":{"id":"jnSXO0_R5dCF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Bigquery initialization\n","DATASET_NAME = \"bqmlga4\"\n","!bq mk --location=$REGION --dataset $PROJECT_ID:$DATASET_NAME"],"metadata":{"id":"AjPKv3Q35ffS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Analysis and Preprosessing "],"metadata":{"id":"_hnLLTGv85th"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###Step 1: Identifying the label for each user"],"metadata":{"id":"qGXQ0Fuz9Ohr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"OAamkVIU8_Oc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 2.
